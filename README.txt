======================================
 Campaign app for Django applications
======================================

This application allows lightweight management of small-time political
campaigns. For example, I used this to help a friend run for city council in a
small town. (He won!)

This code is fairly old, and I am not certain what version of Django it
requires. I am simply putting it here for storage.
